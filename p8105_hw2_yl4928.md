## Problem 1

# Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

# omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data

``` r
mtw_df = 
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls))
```

Read and clean precipitation data for 2018 and 2019. For each, omit rows
without precipitation data and add a variable for year. Next, combine
precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable (the
variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).

``` r
precipitation_2018_df = 
   read_excel(
     "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
   sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
   range = "A2:B14") %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>%
drop_na(total) %>%
mutate(year = 2018)
```

``` r
precipitation_2019_df = 
    read_excel(
      "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
drop_na(total) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)
```

# combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable

``` r
precipitation_df = 
  bind_rows(precipitation_2018_df, precipitation_2019_df) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

Write a paragraph about these data

There are 344 observations in the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet. There are 18
observations in the combined precipitation datasets of 2018 and 2019.
Examples of key variables include `month` and `year`. The total
precipitation in 2018 is 70.33. The total precipitation in 2019 is
16.67. The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 is 8.5.

## Question\_2

# part\_a.

clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day replace month
number with month name create a president variable taking values gop and
dem, and remove prez\_dem and prez\_gop and remove the day variable.

``` r
polsmonth_df = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(month = as.integer(month),
         month = month.name[month],
         president = ifelse(prez_gop == 0, "dem", "gop")) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem & -prez_gop & -day)
```

# Part\_b

clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above. For
consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month, and
organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
 snp_df = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         month = as.integer(month),
         day = as.integer(day),
         month = month.name[month]
         ) %>% 
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  relocate(year, month)
```
